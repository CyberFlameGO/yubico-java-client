This is a validation client for use with the Yubico validation API version 2. To pull in the dependency in a maven project do:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.yubico</groupId>
  <artifactId>yubico-validation-client2</artifactId>
  <validationersion>2.0RC4</version>
</dependency>
```

Basic usage would be:

```java
YubicoClient client = YubicoClient.getClient(CLIENT_ID);
YubicoResponse response = client.verify(otp);
if(response != null && response.getStatus() == YubicoResponseStatus.OK) {
  // otp verified successfully
}
```

After verifying the OTP you should make sure that it belongs to the
correct user. For generic login cases the JAAS module can be easier to
implement.

For more complete descriptions of methods and failure states, please see
the javadoc.
