== yubico-java-client
This repository contains a Java library, as well as a 
https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-java-client/tree/master/jaas[JAAS module],
to validate YubiKey OTPs (One-Time Passwords).

By default, this library uses the Yubico YubiCloud validation platform,
but it can be configured for another validation server.

NOTE: For more details on how to use YubiKey OTP libraries, visit
https://developers.yubico.com/OTP[developers.yubico.com/OTP].

=== Usage

Add this to your pom.xml:

[source,xml]
 <dependency>
   <groupId>com.yubico</groupId>
   <artifactId>yubico-validation-client2</artifactId>
   <version>2.0.1</version>
 </dependency>

A simple implementation would be:

[source,java]
 // otp is the OTP from the Yubikey
 // clientId is the client ID from https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/
 boolean validate(String otp, int clientId) {
    YubicoClient client = YubicoClient.getClient(clientId);
    YubicoResponse response = client.verify(otp);
    return response.getStatus() == YubicoResponseStatus.OK;
 }

After validating the OTP you should make sure that the publicId part belongs to
the correct user. For example:

[source,java]
YubicoClient.getPublicId(otp)
    .equals(/* Yubikey ID associated with the user */);

Read more about this https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-val/Getting_Started_Writing_Clients.html[here].

=== Logging
The validation client depends on slf4j-api for logging. To get the actual logs
and not receive warnings on System.out you will need to depend on a slf4j logger
binding, for example slf4j-log4j with the following maven configuration:

[source,xml]
 <dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-log4j</artifactId>
  <version>1.6.1</version>
 </dependency>

NOTE: If you want the client for the legacy version 1 of the API, it can be found https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-java-client/tree/master/v1client[here].
