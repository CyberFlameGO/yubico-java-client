This is java clients from Yubico for validation of YubiKey OTPs. It's
constructed of three submodules:

* v1client for the Yubico validation API version 1
* v2client for the Yubico validation API version 2
* jaas that is a JAAS module, using v2client

By default all parts use the Yubico YubiCloud validation platform, but can
be configured for another validaiton server. To use YubiCloud you need a
client id and an API key that can be fetched from
https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/.

All artifacts are published in the Maven Central Repository under the
groupId com.yubico with artifactId:

* v1client -> yubico-validation-client1
* v2client -> yubico-validation-client2
* jaas -> yubico-jaas-module

See README under each submodule for specific usage.
